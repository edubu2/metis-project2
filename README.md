## Regression: Using NFL Team statistics to predict next year's win/loss record

Duration: 10 days (in progress, due Jan 22)

## Ideas/Notes (in progress)

- are different features better predictors for different teams? (i.e. bears + 300 passing yards may have larger impact than Chiefs)
- must get L1/L2/L3 game trends for each team_year (weighting last game higher than previous, higher than previous)
