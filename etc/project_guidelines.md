# Project 2: Regression
###### Weeks 2 and 3

## Backstory:

Using information we scrape from the web, build linear regression models from which we can learn about movies, sports, or categories.

## Data:

 * **acquisition**: web scraping
 * **storage**: flat files
 * **sources**: (as listed below or any other publicly available information)   
  - movie: boxofficemojo.com, imdb.com   
  - sports: sports-reference.com
  

## Skills:

 * basics of the web (requests, HTML, CSS, JavaScript)
 * web scraping (e.g., `beautifulsoup`)
 * `numpy` and `pandas`
 * `statsmodels`, `scikit-learn`


## Analysis:

 * linear regression is required, other regression methods are optional


## Deliverables:

 * organized project repository (on GitHub)
   * a project [README.md](#project-readme) file
   * all code used
   * well documented notebooks (e.g., write-up of process and results)
   * slide presentation (as PDF)
   * *no need to push data files (e.g., .pkl, .mtx, .csv, etc.)*
 * visual and oral communication in presentations (5 minutes)

#### Project README
Your project README.md file should contain the following:
- Project Title
- Description
- Features and Target Variables
- Data Used (e.g., NYC Open Data)
- Tools Used (e.g., Scrapy, Seaborn, etc.)
- Possible impacts of your project


## Milestones:

You should plan to employ an [iterative project design process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(software_development)), and expect to have an MVP ready shortly after finalizing your idea. Refer to the schedule below for Project 2 timeline:

Date | Milestone
--- | ---
Week 2 Day 1 @ Lecture Time | N/A (Project Intro)
Week 2 Day 3 @ EOD\* | Post a message with your project idea to your campus's projects Slack channel (i.e., **\#projects_lasso** or **\#projects_ridge**). *Include a super short version of the [project README](#project-readme) information, above.*
Week 2 Day 5 @ EOD | Data Acquired
Week 3 Day 1 @ Afternoon Project Session | MVP Complete (e.g., ready to show a screenshot and give a 1 minute description of your current model)
Week 3 Day 4 @ EOD | Presentable results *(no need to be final)*
Week 3 Day 5 @ Morning | Presentation Day!

*\*Note: If absolutely necessary, you may still pivot after this point, but in general this will be your working project idea.*

## More information:

We'll learn about web scraping using two popular tools - BeautifulSoup and Selenium. You must know the very basics of HTML. We can also evolve the way we use Jupyter notebooks; during this project, we begin to use the notebook as a development scratchpad, where we test things out through interactive scripting, but then solidify our work in python modules with reusable functions and classes.

We'll practice using linear regression. We'll have a first taste of feature selection, this time based on our intuition and some trial and error, and we'll build and refine our models.

This project will give you the freedom to challenge yourself, no matter your skill level. Find your boundaries and push them a little further. We are very excited to see what you will learn and do for Project Luther!
